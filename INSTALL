Installation:

Note: These install instructions were originally from matlab.el and need some
      revising.

ToDo: Add mlint & tlc descriptionis here.

-----

Put the this file as "matlab.el" somewhere on your load path, then
add this to your .emacs or site-init.el file:

  (autoload 'matlab-mode "matlab" "Enter MATLAB mode." t)
  (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.m\\'" . matlab-mode) auto-mode-alist))
  (autoload 'matlab-shell "matlab" "Interactive MATLAB mode." t)

User Level customizations (You need not use them all):
  (setq matlab-indent-function-body t)  ; if you want function bodies indented
  (setq matlab-verify-on-save-flag nil) ; turn off auto-verify on save
  (defun my-matlab-mode-hook ()
    (setq fill-column 76))		; where auto-fill should wrap
  (add-hook 'matlab-mode-hook 'my-matlab-mode-hook)
  (defun my-matlab-shell-mode-hook ()
	'())
  (add-hook 'matlab-shell-mode-hook 'my-matlab-shell-mode-hook)

Please read the mode help for matlab-mode for additional
configuration options.

Syntax highlighting:
  To get font-lock try adding this for older emacsen:
    (font-lock-mode 1)
  Or for newer versions of Emacs:
    (global-font-lock-mode t)
  To get hilit19 support try adding:
    (matlab-mode-hilit)

This package requires easymenu, tempo, and derived.
This package will optionally use custom, shell, and gud.
This package supports language specific extensions in imenu, func-menu,
     speedbar, font-lock, and hilit19.
